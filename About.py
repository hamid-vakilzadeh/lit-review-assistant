            In June 2023, we started AIRA, an experimental AI-powered research assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). 
                   Our goal was simple: help researchers navigate and summarize extensive academic literature through easy-to-use prompts. 
                   At that time, RAG represented cutting-edge technology that significantly simplified literature reviews.

            AI technology advanced rapidly. By the time we published the AIRA paper, we had already moved ahead with MCPâ€”a stronger, upgraded research assistant. 
                   MCP builds on the initial AIRA idea but uses newer AI models to offer better performance, increased flexibility, and an improved researcher experience.

            Explore the original AIRA research paper, and if you use it, please cite our work. Also, be sure to check out MCP to see how far weâ€™ve advanced since our initial release.

            ðŸ“„ Read and cite the paper: [**Vakilzadeh, H., and Wood, D. A. (2025). The Development of a RAG-Based Artificial Intelligence Research Assistant (AIRA). _Journal of Information Systems. forthcoming_.**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5283702)

            ## How to Install MCP?

            1. Make sure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) app (you do NOT need a paid subscription to use this MCP),
            1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

            1. Next, open your **terminal on MacOS** or **CMD on Windows** and run the following command:
                   
                   
                ```
                npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @hamid-vakilzadeh/mcpsemanticscholar --client claude
                ```

            This will install the AIRA application MCP Server via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@hamid-vakilzadeh/mcpsemanticscholar).
                   
            1. Finally, **restart Claude Desktop** and the MCP should appear in search and tools. This means that you should fully close and reopen the app. This means that on Windows, you should right-click on the taskbar icon and select "Close window" or "Quit" to ensure that the app is fully closed. On macOS, you can use Command + Q to quit the app.

            ### Troubleshooting:
                   
            - **Admin Rights in Windows**: If you are using Windows, you may need to run the command prompt as an administrator. To do this, search for "cmd" in the Start menu, right-click on "Command Prompt," and select "Run as administrator."
            - **macOS**: If you are using macOS, you can open the Terminal app and run the command directly.
            - **System Administrator**: If you are not the administrator of your computer, you may need to ask your system administrator to run the command for you. This may be necessary if you are using a work or school computer that has restrictions on installing software.
            - **npx Not Recognized**: If npx is not recognized after installation restart your terminal or command prompt.
            - **MCP Not Appearing**: If you everything is installed correctly but the MCP does not appear in Claude Desktop, try restarting the app. This means that on Windows, you should right-click on the taskbar icon and select "Close window" or "Quit" to ensure that the app is fully closed. On macOS, you can use Command + Q to quit the app. If that doesn't work, kill the process from the **Activity Monitor (macOS)** or **Task Manager (Windows)** or try restarting your computer.
            - **ChatGPT does not support MCP technology**: Please note that the MCP technology is not supported in ChatGPT YET. But it is planned for future updates. So if you are a dedicated ChatGPT user, you may have to wait for them to support it.
