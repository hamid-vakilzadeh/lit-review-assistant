            **Two Years of AIRA: From RAG to MCP**

            In June 2023, we started AIRA, an experimental AI-powered research assistant using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). 
                   Our goal was simple: help researchers navigate and summarize extensive academic literature through easy-to-use prompts. 
                   At that time, RAG represented cutting-edge technology that significantly simplified literature reviews.

            AI technology advanced rapidly. By the time we published the AIRA paper, we had already moved ahead with MCPâ€”a stronger, upgraded research assistant. 
                   MCP builds on the initial AIRA idea but uses newer AI models to offer better performance, increased flexibility, and an improved researcher experience.

            Explore the original AIRA research paper, and if you use it, please cite our work. Also, be sure to check out MCP to see how far weâ€™ve advanced since our initial release.

            **How to Install MCP?**

            First, make sure you've downloaded and installed the [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) app and you have [npm](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

            To install this MCP Server via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@hamid-vakilzadeh/mcpsemanticscholar) open your terminal/CMD and run the following command:

                npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install @hamid-vakilzadeh/mcpsemanticscholar --client claude
            
            Finally, restart Claude Desktop and the MCP should apper in search and tools.
